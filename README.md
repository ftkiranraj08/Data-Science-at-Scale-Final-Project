## Context

I noticed that my project repository does not contain any recent commits reflecting my latest work. I’d like to explain why this happened.

## Explanation

- **Guidelines Missed:**  
  I was not aware of the specific Git commit and push guidelines outlined for this assignment. Without clear direction on commit frequency and branch conventions, I delayed making commits until I fully understood the expectations.

- **Work Completed Locally:**  
  All of my code development and testing have been performed on my local machine. Although progress has been made, I did not synchronize these changes to the remote repository.

## Next Steps

1. **Review Guidelines:**  
   I will carefully review the Git workflow and commit guidelines provided in the course materials to ensure compliance going forward.

2. **Immediate Push:**  
   I plan to stage and commit all current changes tonight and push them to the remote repository by [specific time, e.g., “9 PM today”].

3. **Commit Strategy:**  
   - Commit after completing each major feature or bug fix  
   - Use descriptive commit messages  
   - Follow the branch naming conventions outlined in the project guidelines

## Apology and Commitment

I apologize for the oversight and any inconvenience it may have caused. Moving forward, I will adhere strictly to the version control guidelines to maintain a clear, up-to-date project history.

Thank you for your understanding. Please let me know if there are any additional steps I should take.
